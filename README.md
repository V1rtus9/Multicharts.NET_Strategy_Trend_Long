# Multicharts.NET Strategy Weekly Dema Break

Simple strategy for Multicharts.NET. Developed by V1rtus9 in 2016.

Strategy algorithm: 
      1. Enter condition: weekly dema + EnterRate(%)
      2. Exit condition: initial stoploss or trailing stoploss
      
It's long-term strategy. Minimum period that I have tested is 5 years. Strategy generates profit only on a long trend markets, in flat it will lose the capital. There is no algorithm for short trading, only long.
